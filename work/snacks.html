				<small class="colorCaption">2017 Â· Design Systems</small>
			</section>

			<p>In 2017, Design Systems were just gaining steam within the design industry. At Instacart, we had worked off of simple brand guidelines and basic style guides I had created between projects, but the team was growing and our ambitions were growing too. Each page varied widely as we built more and more product. We needed a way to make sure we weren't shuffling users from one designer's world to another's.</p>

			<h2 class="h2 colorDefault marginBottom8">Background</h2>

			<p>Our first attempt at a unified design system (even though we hadn't called it that) was back in 2015. The company was small but we were beginning to have multiple engineers and designers touching parts of the product. So how do you solve that quickly? We forked Bootstrap, modified it heavily to our use cases (and named it Beetstrap for kicks). That had gotten us far. But designers wanted to work to evolve our design language. After a few years, it was showing it's age visually and we hadn't put a lot of time in educating a growing team about how to use it. After a while it became "that place we pull icons from". We knew we had to push further.</p>

			<p>In 2017 another goal was coming into focus based on our sales numbers. In the past, we had set up our designers and web developers with simple, reusable components. But our iOS and Android developers were not given that same time and attention. Since our first attempt at a unified system, our mobile app sales were growing drastically every year and were finally beginning to cross the order numbers we were seeing from desktop computers. So we set out to make this mobile-centric as well.</p>

			<h2 class="h2 colorDefault marginBottom24">The Approach</h2>

			<h3 class="h3 colorSecondary marginBottom8">Set a deadline</h3>
			<p>At this point we had seven designers and each of them was working on tons of projects across the organization. So we had to make sure this work was getting done while also ensuring we couldn't block all of engineering. So setting a deadline of 3 months to design and present the new system was a number we were able to all agree on. The designers and engineers who were interested in contributing would save a portion of their week and put it towards this work.</p>

			<h3 class="h3 colorSecondary marginBottom8">Catalog everything</h3>
			<p>We budgeted two weeks to give each designer time to look through everything we already had. This would be essential when it came time to replace things, understand use cases for each component, and also helped us make our case that the project was important. We found </p>

			<h3 class="h3 colorSecondary marginBottom8">Make a wish list along the way</h3>
			<p></p>

			<h3 class="h3 colorSecondary marginBottom8">Build foundations</h3>
			<p></p>

			<h3 class="h3 colorSecondary marginBottom8">Keep the use case close</h3>
			<p></p>

			<img class="full-width" src="../images/work/snacks-teams.png" alt="Three teams shown: cards & containers, forms & feedback, and navigation & actions"/>

			<h3 class="h3 colorSecondary marginBottom8">Split up the work</h3>
			<p></p>

			<h3 class="h3 colorSecondary marginBottom8">Socialize it</h3>
			<p>To make sure we got as many eyeballs on the new system as possible, we made sure we included the team that would be using this thing into our process as much as we could.
We had guests in design reviews,
We posted work to slack
we hung stuff up so folks would walk past it
Our best ideas was a gallery day.
	we got a bunch of wine and cheese, played music
	Printed out work and stood besides it
	we invited the entire org to come by and look at everything and give feedback.


Food and drinks are sometimes the best way to get people interested!
